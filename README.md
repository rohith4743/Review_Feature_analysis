Online customers rely on online reviews before taking purchase decisions which may be jeopardized if there is a juxtaposition of computer-generated and original reviews in the same place. In this study we took a systematic approach to find out a guide to help people distinguish the reviews without any complex technological knowledge. The results found from the user study shows a drastic change in identifying CG reviews with the help of the guide created from linguistic and lexical analysis of the reviews. We argue that this method is helpful for online customers to take purchase decisions perfectly without losing any trust on the companies because of the CG reviews present in internet.
